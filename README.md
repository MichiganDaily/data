# data-public
A public repository for datasets that we've collected.

## When to add
Only add data to this repository for published works. This data should be thoroughly cleaned and should correspond to the published data visuals. All other data should be stored in [`data-private`](https://github.com/MichiganDaily/data-private/).

## How to add
If you have a new dataset, create a new folder, and place your cleaned final csv and a readme describing what the data is, how it was retrieved, and when it was retrieved, and include a description for each column in the csv.
